% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
 The technology in automobile industry has made some remarkable progress the last century. They have managed to
 make safe, reliable and affordable vehicles. The last couple of decades have seen significant advancements
 in computation and communication technologies, and consequentially autonomous vehicles (AV) are now becoming a reality \cite{IEEE:AutonomousCars}.
 Several prototypes exists today. Among others, Volvo have started implementing autonomous trucks that deliver goods \cite{Sawers2019}.
 \subsection{Autonomous vehicles}
	 \subsubsection{What is it?}
		 A definition of autonomous vehicle (AV) can be a vehicle which senses it's environment with little or no human input or interaction
		 This means that the vehicle is capable of gathering information about the environment around it such as objects, temperature, position, velocity etc. And
		 execute tasks or functions according to certain directives.
	 \subsubsection{Why?}
		 Humans are biological lifeforms which depends and reacts on, among other things but not limited to, sleep, food,
		 stress, isolation, social interactions and other similar processes. Besides being complex lifeforms
		 humans react differently to these processes choices taken, in certain situations, differ greatly.

		 Machines today are not dependent on such stimuli and therefor they can, theoretically, continue with tasks to an
		 infinite amount of time. At mundane and repeated tasks such as arithmetic calculations or retaining huge amounts of data,
		 machines and computers excel with unrivalled precision and accuracy. This makes them good candidates for making
		 pure rational and logical decisions based on optimal outcomes of certain criteria.

		 Based on this assessment machines would take more optimal choices over time in comparison with the average human.
		 And their choices would be easier to determine based on simulations and testing scenarios.
		 This would make outcomes and outputs deterministic and easy to predict and consequentially present a good
		 basis for development and optimization.

\section{Theory}
 \subsection{Technology}
	 A brief presentation on certain technologies implemented in todays land based vehicles. Both autonomous
	 and nonautonomous.
	 \subsubsection{Real Time Operating System}
		 Cars today rely on numbers of sensors to acquire information about their surroundings.
		 The velocity, GPS, proximity to obstacles, temperature etc. This sensors communicate to certain
		 modules that is connected to a operating system (OS). This is often a specialized form
		 of OS. A so called Real Time Operating System (RTOS) makes up the central core and processor
		 of the car. Within, all decisions based on data form the sensors are made and functions
		 executed. Some aspects of RTOS are presented here.

		 \paragraph{Hardt time RTOS}
		 A deterministic RTOS. Meaning that the output of the RTOS should happen within a certain
		 time or deadline. Used in mission critical systems like medical devices, fight control
		 space shuttles etcetera.

		 \paragraph{Soft time RTOS}
		 Not as deterministic as Hard Time, but deadline of tasks and processes should be met within
		 certain limits. The RTOS performance will degrade if tasks are never done within deadline and
		 would be useless. Examples here can be audio-visual-systems for entertainment, games and general purpose
		 OS's like Windows, Ubuntu and iOS.
	 \subsubsection{Camera}
		 Cameras are indispensable for providing visual information and feedback to any system,
		 in regards to its environment. In comparison to radar, LIDAR or similar sensors,
		 cameras are affected by weather, dust and pollution.
	 \subsubsection{RADAR}
		 Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) can complement the camera and is resistant to both
		 pollution, weather and similar. It emits electromagnetic waves which reflects on obstacles
		 and back to the RADAR. Distance, velocity and position (relative to the RADAR) can then
		 be calculated with great accuracy. There are different types of RADAR and the most used
		 is Frequency-modulated continuous Wave (FMCW).

		 \paragraph{FMWC}
		 Allows the detection of small objects with the use of the Doppler effect. Since the
		 known transmitted frequency is known, stable and slow-moving objects can be filtered
		 out of the receiving signal. This reduces interference and increases the signal to noise
		 ratio.
	 \subsubsection{LIDAR}
		 Goes under many names. One of them is "Laser Imaging and Ranging".
		 This method utilizes laser beams and their reflection of of objects to measure distance.
		 Also called ranging. The lidar's output would be point cloud data, which provides all the
		 necessary information, to a software for detecting and determining where potential
		 obstacles and objects are located in the environment.
	 \subsubsection{GPS}
		 A property of the United States Government. GPS is acronym for "Global Positioning System".
		 It utilizes satellites for positioning. The system is freely available for anyone with a GPS
		 receiver and has global coverage. Several other systems from other countries exists.
		 As long as a GPS receiver has line of sight to four or more satellites, a pinpoint of
		 position can happen with an accuracy of two meters or less.

 \subsection{Autonomy}
	 The definition for autonomy would be the capacity to make informed and uncoerced decisions,
	 based on some set of information. From a more metaphoric perspective, this would be that
	 an entity, person or organization would be given self-governing capacity. This to make
	 decisions not forced on it by a higher ranking entity, regime, person etc.

 \subsection{Machine learning}
	 Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and by definition is "the study of
	 computer algorithms that improves automaticcaly through experience" \cite{Wiki:ML}.
	 Said in simpler terms it makes the machine/system learn from experience without beeing explicitly
	 programmed, but to do so it need a lot of data. This data set is divided in to "training data" and
	 "testing data", where the "training data" obviously is used to train the model and the "testing data"
	 is used to check the accuracy of the model.

	 ML is often devided into three categories:
	 \begin{enumerate}
		 \item \textbf{Supervised learning:}\\
		       This type of algorithms is designed to learn by example, and the idea behind is that training this type of algorithms is like having
		       a "supervisor" watching over the whole prosess. The training data consists of input that is paired with the correct output and during
		       training the algorithm will search for patterns that correlates to the desired output. After training you get a model that takes new
		       unseen input data (of the same kind) and determine which label this new inputs classifies as based on the training data. The whole essence
		       of this kind of algorithms is to predict the correct label for newly presented inputs based on past data. On it's simplest form it can be written as
		       $$ Y = f(x) $$ where $Y$ is the desired output from the mapping function $f$ with value $x$ \cite{towardsDataSience:SL}. Supervised learning can be devided in to two categories
			   
			   \paragraph{Classification}
			    This algorithm is typically used to put the new data into a category or a class based on it's training data. Under training this algorithm
				will be given data points with an assigned category. The most common example is filtering out spam emails.
			 
				\paragraph{Regression}
				This algorithm is a predictive statistical process where the model tries to find relationship between dependent and independent variables
			    in the data set. The goal of a regression algorithm is to predict a continuous number such as sales, income, and test scores.
		       

		 \item \textbf{Unsupervised learning:}\\
		       In contrary to supervised learning that needs to train it's algorithms to recognize patterns in dataset with known labels, unsupervised learning
		       is used on big dataset to recognize patterns in unlabeled dataset. In simpler terms this type of algorithm learns useful patterns and properties in
		       the data structure in big datasets with no labels. The most used algorithm used in unsupervised learing is cluster analysis \cite{deepAI:UL} \cite{Wiki:UL}.

		       \paragraph{Cluster analysis}
		       Cluster analysis, also called clustering, is used to group datasets with shared properties in order to find algorithmic relationships. Each group made is
		       called a cluster hence the name cluster analysis or clustering, but the name "cluster" can not be precisely defined. Since the notion cluster isn't well defined
		       there are many different clusering algorithms out there, but they all have one thing in common they group data \cite{Wiki:CA}.

		 \item \textbf{Reinforcement learning:}\\
		       Reinforcement learning (RL) agent is learning by interacting with an environment, in other words it learns from the consequences of its actions. The RL agent can
		       do this because of a numerical reward system that encodes the sucsess of an action's outcome. The RL agent seeks to learn how to find the actions that accumulate the
			   most reward over time. The RL agent learns from exploring it's environment and making decision upon how to act in every singel scenario, instead of explicitly getting tought
			   how to respond in advance. Thus this kind of algorithms is very complicated compared to the other two other ML categories algorithms \cite{Scholar:RL}.

	 What kind of algorithm used is dependent on computational ability and determined on what kind of technology
	 implemented within the AV. Be it GPS, LIDAR or similar. There is no problem
	 implementing all sorts of algorithms, but a factor that limits range of viable candidates

 % An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
 % Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
 % For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
 % Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
 % is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
 % even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
 % of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
 % \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
 %
 % Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
 % option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
 % displayed while in draft mode.

 % reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


 % An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
 % \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
 % \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
 % The \label must come after \caption as always.

 % Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
 % anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
 % positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
 % exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
 % footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
 % command of the stfloats package.
