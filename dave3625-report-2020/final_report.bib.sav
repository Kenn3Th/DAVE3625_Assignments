  abstract  = {Many research centres in the world that deal with the problems of the manufacture of land
vehicles, especially those intended for transport and communication in urban traffic, are still working on the
development of a vehicle equipped with systems that do not require human participation in the process of driving
a vehicle. The goals to be pursued are to ensure maximum safety (minimize accidents involving people) and to
optimize transport costs (eliminating the driver from the vehicle, optimal route selection). This article, which is
the result of broad studies conducted at OBRUM, discusses the development paths of autonomous vehicles and
key algorithms of autonomous vehicles described in detail in the literature cited. The presented results constitute
a starting point for further work on an autonomous vehicle to be carried out at OBRUM.},

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.},
