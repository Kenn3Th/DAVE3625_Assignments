  abstract  = {Many research centres in the world that deal with the problems of the manufacture of land
vehicles, especially those intended for transport and communication in urban traffic, are still working on the
development of a vehicle equipped with systems that do not require human participation in the process of driving
a vehicle. The goals to be pursued are to ensure maximum safety (minimize accidents involving people) and to
optimize transport costs (eliminating the driver from the vehicle, optimal route selection). This article, which is
the result of broad studies conducted at OBRUM, discusses the development paths of autonomous vehicles and
key algorithms of autonomous vehicles described in detail in the literature cited. The presented results constitute
a starting point for further work on an autonomous vehicle to be carried out at OBRUM.},

In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs.[1] It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning, a related variant, makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques.},

An RL agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being explicitly taught and it selects its actions on basis of its past experiences (exploitation) and also by new choices (exploration), which is essentially trial and error learning. The reinforcement signal that the RL-agent receives is a numerical reward, which encodes the success of an action's outcome, and the agent seeks to learn to select actions that maximize the accumulated reward over time. (The use of the term reward is used here in a neutral fashion and does not imply any pleasure, hedonic impact or other psychological interpretations.)},
